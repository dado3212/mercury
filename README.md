Mercury is a Cydia tweak that adds a customizable indicator to messages that you haven't responded to.  I've been using it personally for a bit over a year now, so figured it was time to polish it up a little and release it.  I developed a less fully-featured Mac version as well, which you can download/install using SIMBL (described in [this repo](https://github.com/dado3212/message-indicator)).

### Installation

To install it, either install from the .deb in this repo, or add the repository http://cydia.alexbeals.com to Cydia and download Mercury.

### Modification

To start modifying it, simply copy the full folder in, and then symlink folders called 'theos' to $(THEOS) in both the preferences folder and the main folder.  You can create and install the tweak using 'make package install'.

You'll also need a custom set of `include` files in the $(THEOS) directory.  You can find that in the theos-headers repo.
